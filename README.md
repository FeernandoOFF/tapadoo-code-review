# Tapadoo Programing test

## Requirements

1. We have documented a web services api at http://docs.tpbookserver.apiary.io

2. We'd like you to build a master/detail app which uses this Web Services API to retrieve it's data

3. It's up to you how you build the interface, etc.

When done, please send us the zipped up source, and we'll take it from there!

As you see, it's not very prescriptive. This is on purpose.

The only tips we give are:

1. Treat your code as if it will be code reviewed.

2. Treat it as if you're showcasing your skills.

3. Imagine it was going live
