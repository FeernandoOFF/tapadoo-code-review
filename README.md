# Tapadoo Programing test

## Requirements

1. We have documented a web services api at http://docs.tpbookserver.apiary.io

2. We'd like you to build a master/detail app which uses this Web Services API to retrieve it's data

3. It's up to you how you build the interface, etc.

When done, please send us the zipped up source, and we'll take it from there!

As you see, it's not very prescriptive. This is on purpose.

The only tips we give are:

1. Treat your code as if it will be code reviewed.

2. Treat it as if you're showcasing your skills.

3. Imagine it was going live

## The solution

### The data

I use the BookServer API for get the initial books and based on the ISBN call a Google API that gives me a description and Images.
Some of these books come with no title, so i have to filter them out

### The gestures

I use Framer-Motion in order to make some animations and mainly gestures for mobile
